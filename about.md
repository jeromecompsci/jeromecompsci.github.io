      <strong>Hackathons</strong>

  <p>  <div class="manual-content">
What is a hackathon? MLH defines it as an “invention marathon”. Anyone who has an interest in technology attends a hackathon to learn, build & share their creations over the course of a weekend in a relaxed and welcoming atmosphere. We plan to attend at least one hackathon over the course of this school year.
