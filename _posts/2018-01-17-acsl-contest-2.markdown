We'll be doing the ACSL Contest 2 math section after our meeting on Thursday in the Computer Science room. Because this is a late announcement, you may reschedule with Mrs. Fuller if you are not available that day or feel overly unprepared. 

The Contest 2 math section on Thursday will include problems on Pre/Post/Infix Notation, Bit-String Flicking, and LISP. To learn the material for Contest 2, use the resources posted [earlier](http://jerometech.club/2017/11/03/acsl-resources.html) are/or materials for Contest 2 [here](http://wmcicompsci.ca/club/acsl/) and/or the [following](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gCKx3KNCAfOPn1i_h4cKUqhQadWA-PzS/view?usp=sharing) worksheets.

The program will be posted after Thursday to give you more time to focus on preparing for the math section.
