Hello everyone! Our first meeting will take place on Monday, September 19th (to be confirmed.) We will have an info session with details on potential trips, dues, and projects. Then we will pick a club project from a list of projects developed by our officers. Finally, we will get involved through a small fun activity that requires no programming experience. The location of the meeting will be posted soon.
