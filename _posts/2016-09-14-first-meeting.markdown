Hello everyone! Our first meeting will take place on Monday, September 19th. We will have an info session with details on potential trips, dues, and projects. Then we will pick a club project from a list of projects developed by our officers. Finally, we will get involved through a small fun activity that requires no programming experience. The meeting will take place in B203, Japanese/Health room.
