## **In Club Activities**

We plan to have club meetings at least once a month on Thursdays. We will have a variety of activities involving computer hardware and programming. The Remind message every week should include what we are doing that week. If you want to do anything different this year, please tell us!

## **Competitions**

We have two competitions that we participate in- ACSL and the CBUS Student Hack.

ACSL is for those who know Java and have CS experience. It consists of 4 preliminary competitions that you must complete alone and then a All-Star Contest as a team if we qualify. This yearâ€™s All-Star Contest will be held on Saturday, May 26, 2018 in Rhode Island. Check the following [post](http://jerometech.club/2017/11/03/acsl-resources.html) to get more info.

The CBUS Student hack is for anyone, regardless of experience programming. It is a 7-week programming contest organized by Franklin University and AT&T that takes place in Columbus. The event aims at promoting computer science education and providing High School students with 21st century skills needed for college and career readiness. Participating teams will focus on developing mobile applications and will use one of three approved application development tools or an application development tool of their choice. There will be a kick off and presentation event that we will provide buses to.

## **Middle School Outreach Program**

This year we are helping Grizzell Middle School start a Computer Science club in order to spread interest in CS. We'll be going to Grizzell at least once a month starting November to teach them CS concepts. Contact Sahil (ambardekarsahil@gmail.com) if you are interested in helping out.
