We will be meeting in C107 (the CS room) after school. Bring your laptop if possible! This page will be updated with resources after the meeting.

UPDATE:

We picked out two projects for this year:<br>
- Jerome Planner App<br>
- Taking apart old computers

We also reviewed very basic HTML from the last meeting and covered the header tags (<h1>, <h2>, and so on) If you ever have questions about HTML or dont remember the use of an element you can use the following webpage:
