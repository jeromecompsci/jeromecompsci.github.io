If you are doing ACSL- we are doing a practice contest 1 on Thursday (7th) in Mrs. Fullers room. The program section will be posted here tommorrow and you will turn it in when we do the math section after school on Thursday. We assume you will be there if interested in ACSL, otherwise contact us saying why you cant make it. Please see the [ACSL Resources](http://jerometech.club/2017/11/03/acsl-resources.html) post to study.

For everyone- We will also have a regular meeting on Monday, December 11th. We are going to start learning HTML and CSS (website design).
