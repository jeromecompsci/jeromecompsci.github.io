ACSL consists of 4 preliminary competitions that you must complete alone and then a All-Star Contest as a team if we qualify. This year's All-Star Contest will be held on Saturday, May 26, 2018 (US Memorial Day weekend) at Barrington High School in Barrington, Rhode Island. Each preliminary competition consists of a program and a math section. The math section covers many topics for which a pdf is listed below. You will have 30 minutes to complete it. The program is a long problem for which you must create a Java program. You will have 3 days to work on this and then our advisor, Mrs. Fuller, will run it against the test data/inputs. The program includes sample data points with output. For each test data point that produces the correct output you will receive one point. ACSL awards plaques to top scoring students and top scoring teams are invited to compete at the All-Star Contest.
